# This YAML file gets processed into a collection of data structures and
# variable initializers describing Colossal Cave.  It replaces an ad-hoc
# text database shipped with Adventure versions up to 2.5.  The format
# change enabled a lot of use of symbolic names where there were previously
# inscrutable numeric literals.
#
# We define a bunch of YAML structures:
#
# motions: Motion words, grouped into synonyms.  The 'oldstyle'
#    attribute, if false, means that single-letter synonyms should be
#    accepted in oldstyle mode; it defaults to true.
#
# actions: Action words, grouped into synonyms, and their corresponding
#    default messages. The 'oldstyle' attribute is as for motions.
#
# hints: Each item contains a hint number, a hint label (used to
#    generate the value macro for the hint) the number of turns he
#    must be at the right loc(s) before triggering the hint, the
#    points deducted for taking the hint, the message number (in
#    arbitrary_messages) of the question, and the message number of
#    the hint.
#
# locations: They have attributes as follows...
#      long:         Long description, always shown on first encounter.
#      short:        Short description. If none, use long description.
#      conditions:   A dictionary of attributes
#        LIT		Light
#        OILY		If FLUID flag is on: true for oil, false for water
#        FLUID		Liquid asset
#        NOARRR		Pirate doesn't go here unless following player
#        NOBACK		Cannot use "back" to move away
#        HCAVE		Trying to get into cave
#        HBIRD		Trying to catch bird
#        HSNAKE		Trying to deal with snake
#        HMAZE		Lost in maze
#        HDARK		Pondering dark room
#        HWITT		At Witt's End
#        HCLIFF		Cliff with urn
#        HWOODS		Lost in forest
#        HOGRE		Trying to deal with ogre
#        HJADE		Found all treasures except jade
#      hints:        A list of YAML references to hints that may be available at
#                    this location. (This is why locations has to follow hints.)
#      sound:        Label for a location sound.
#      loud:         If true, object sounds are drowned out at this location.
#      travel:       A list of movement rules.  They're applied in the order
#                    they appear.  For a rule to fire, (1) the movement command
#                    must be a synonym for one of its verbs, and (2) the
#                    condition, if present, must evaluate to true. In that case
#                    the action fires.  The action may be a goto (move to
#                    a named location) a speak (utter a named message), or
#                    a special (branch to special case in movement code).
#                    The conditional may be one of the following:
#                      [pct, N]       Roll a die, n% chance of success
#                      [carry, OBJ]   Must be carrying named object
#                      [with, OBJ]    Must be carrying or in room with
#                      [not, OBJ N]   Property of named OBJ must not be N.
#                                     N may be numeric or a state label.
#                      [nodwarves]    Dwarves must skip this rule.
#    All attributes are optional except the long description and
#    travel. Order of locations is not significant.
#
# arbitrary_messages: These are arguments to rspeak(). Some spans of
#    these messages need to be kept adjacent and ordered (for now),
#    though there are no depenencies on actual numbers left.  To see
#    which, grep for rspeak() calls containing expressions with
#    arithmetic.  Eventually, these will be pulled out into more
#    appropriate data structures. Then ordering can be dropped.
#
# classes: Each item contains a point threshold and a message
#    describing a classification of player.  Point thresholds must be
#    in ascending order. The scoring code selects the appropriate
#    message, where each message is considered to apply to players
#    whose scores are higher than the previous N but not higher than
#    this N.  Note that these scores probably change with every
#    modification (and particularly expansion) of the program.
#
# turn_thresholds:  Each item contains a number and a message
#    berating the player for taking so many turns.  When the turn count
#    matches one of the thresholds, the corresponding message is shown.
#    Order doesn't matter; the logic simply tests every threshold on
#    the assumption that turn counts never decrease nor skip values.
#
# objects: Objects have attributes as follows...
#      inventory:    A description for use in the inventory command.
#      states:       A list of state labels for states from 0 up. Each
#                    becomes a #define, and is also a state label that
#                    can be used in travel-rule 'not' clauses.
#      descriptions: Messages describing the object in different states.
#                    Must correspond 1:1 with state labels if the latter exist.
#      changes:      State-change messages to be emitted whenever the object
#                    *changes* to the (0-origin) state that is the index of the
#                    message in this array. Must correspond 1:1 with state
#                    labels if the latter exist.
#      words:        The vocabulary word(s) referring to this object.
#      treasure:     A boolean "treasure" used for point-scoring and pirate
#                    snatches, defaulting to false.
#      immovable:    An object may also be flagged
#                    immovable, meaning it cannot be carried.
#      locations:    An object may have one or two start locations (the gate
#                    is an example of a two-location object; it can be accessed
#                    from above or below).
#
# obituaries: Death messages and reincarnation queries.  Order is
#    significant, they're used in succession as the player racks up
#    deaths.
#
# Message strings may include certain special character sequences to
# denote that the program must provide parameters to insert into a
# message when the message is printed.  These sequences are:
#       %d = an integer
#       %s = an ASCII string
#	%S = The letter 's' or nothing (if a previous %d value is exactly 1)
#	%V = substitute program version string

hints:
  - hint: &grate
      name: CAVE
      number: 1
      turns: 4
      penalty: 2
      question: 'Are you trying to get into the cave?'
      hint: |-
          The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
          enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend
          looking elsewhere for the keys.
  - hint: &bird
      name: BIRD
      number: 2
      turns: 5
      penalty: 2
      question: 'Are you trying to catch the bird?'
      hint: |-
          Something about you seems to be frightening the bird.  Perhaps you
          might figure out what it is.
  - hint: &snake
      name: SNAKE
      number: 3
      turns: 8
      penalty: 2
      question: 'Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?'
      hint: |-
          You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
          like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary
          resources right now.
  - hint: &maze
      name: MAZE
      number: 4
      turns: 75
      penalty: 4
      question: 'Do you need help getting out of the maze?'
      hint: 'You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.'
  - hint: &dark
      name: DARK
      number: 5
      turns: 25
      penalty: 5
      question: 'Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?'
      hint: |-
          There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about
          falling into a pit.  None of the objects available is immediately
          useful in discovering the secret.
  - hint: &witt
      name: WITT
      number: 6
      turns: 20
      penalty: 3
      question: 'Do you need help getting out of here?'
      hint: 'Don''t go west.\n'
  - hint: &urn
      name: CLIFF
      number: 7
      turns: 8
      penalty: 2
      question: 'Are you wondering what to do here?'
      hint: 'This section is quite advanced.  Find the cave first.\n'
  - hint: &forest
      name: WOODS
      number: 8
      turns: 25
      penalty: 2
      question: 'Would you like to be shown out of the forest?'
      hint: |-
          Go east ten times.  If that doesn't get you out, then go south, then
          west twice, then south.
  - hint: &ogre
      name: OGRE
      number: 9
      turns: 10
      penalty: 4
      question: 'Do you need help dealing with the ogre?'
      hint: |-
          There is nothing the presence of which will prevent you from defeating
          him; thus it can't hurt to fetch everything you possibly can.
  - hint: &jade
      name: JADE
      number: 10
      turns: 1
      penalty: 4
      question: 'You''re missing only one other treasure.  Do you need help finding it?'
      hint: |-
        Once you've found all the other treasures, it is no longer possible to
        locate the one you're now missing.

          formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
          light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
          gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
          have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
          crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
          gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To

- CAVE_NEARBY: |-
      Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
      treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
      seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
      and hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn
      you that I look at only the first five letters of each word, so you'll
      have to enter "northeast" as "ne" to distinguish it from "north".
      You can type "help" for some general hints.  For information on how
      to end your adventure, scoring, etc., type "info".
      \t\t\t      - - -

- DWARF_BLOCK: 'A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.'

- AM_GAME: &am_game 'I''m game.  Would you care to explain how?'

- FUTILE_CRAWL: |-
    You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
    main passage.
- FOLLOW_STREAM: |-
      I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on
      the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
- NEED_DETAIL: 'I need more detailed instructions to do that.'
- NEARBY: &nearby |-
      I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate

- NO_CROSS: 'There is no way across the fissure.'
- NO_CARRY: 'You''re not carrying anything.'
- NOW_HOLDING: 'You are currently holding the following:'
- BIRD_PINING: |-
    It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you
    have no bird seed.
- BIRD_DEVOURED: 'The snake has now devoured your bird.'
- NOTHING_EDIBLE: 'There''s nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).'
- REALLY_MAD: 'You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you''ve made him *REALLY* mad!!'
- NO_CONTAINER: 'You have nothing in which to carry it.'

- RIDICULOUS_ATTEMPT: &ridiculous_attempt 'Don''t be ridiculous!'
- RUSTY_DOOR: 'The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.'
- SHAKING_LEAVES: 'The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks, "Water?"'
- DEEP_ROOTS: 'The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.'
- KNIVES_VANISH: 'The dwarves'' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.'
- MUST_DROP: |-
    Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
    You'd best take inventory and drop something.
- CLAM_BLOCKER: 'You can''t fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!'
- OYSTER_BLOCKER: 'You can''t fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage!'
#- DROP_CLAM: 'I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.  >STRAIN!<'
- DROP_OYSTER: 'I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >WRENCH!<'
- CLAM_OPENER: 'You don''t have anything strong enough to open the clam.'
- OYSTER_OPENER: 'You don''t have anything strong enough to open the oyster.'
- PEARL_FALLS: |-
    A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,
    this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying
    bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
- OYSTER_OPENS: |-
    The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
    promptly snaps shut again.
- WAY_BLOCKED: |-
    You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
    blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.
- PIRATE_RUSTLES: 'There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.'
- PIRATE_POUNCES: |-
    Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har,"
    he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
    chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
    the gloom.
- CAVE_CLOSING: |-
    A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "Cave closing
    soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through main office."
- EXIT_CLOSED: |-
    A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
       "This exit is closed.  Please leave via main office."
- DEATH_CLOSING: |-
    It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to
    closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
- CAVE_CLOSED: |-
    The sepulchral voice intones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
    fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
    smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...
- VICTORY_MESSAGE: |-
    There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
    wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
    and find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of
    friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
- DEFEAT_MESSAGE: |-
    There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
    wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours
    in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!
- SPLATTER_MESSAGE: |-
    There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the
    walls of the room.
- DWARVES_AWAKEN: |-
    The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now several
    threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw
    knives at you!  All of them get you!
- UNHAPPY_BIRD: 'Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.'

- NOT_KNOWHOW: &not_knowhow 'I don''t know how.'
- TOO_FAR: 'It is too far up for you to reach.'
- DWARF_SMOKE: |-
      You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
      black smoke.
- SHELL_IMPERVIOUS: 'The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.'
- START_OVER: 'What''s the matter, can''t you read?  Now you''d best start over.'
- WELL_POINTLESS: 'Well, that was remarkably pointless.'
- DRAGON_SCALES: 'The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon''s thick scales.'
- NASTY_DRAGON: 'The dragon looks rather nasty.  You''d best not try to get by.'
- BIRD_BURNT: |-
    The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry
    gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
- BRIEF_CONFIRM: |-
    Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time
    you come to it.  To get the full description, say "look".
- ROCKY_TROLL: |-
    Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
    that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
- TROLL_RETURNS: |-
    The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
    back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
- TROLL_SATISFIED: 'The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.'
- TROLL_BLOCKS: 'The troll refuses to let you cross.'
- BRIDGE_GONE: 'There is no longer any way across the chasm.'

- NO_LOCKSITE: 'There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.'
- WANT_HINT: 'Do you want the hint?'
- TROLL_VICES: 'Gluttony is not one of the troll''s vices.  Avarice, however, is.'
- LAMP_DIM: |-
    Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
    you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
    machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
- LAMP_OUT: 'Your lamp has run out of power.'
- PLEASE_ANSWER: 'Please answer the question.'
- PIRATE_SPOTTED: |-
    There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
    turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
    He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "I've
    been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!"
    With that, he vanishes into the gloom.
- GET_BATTERIES: 'Your lamp is getting dim.  You''d best go back for those batteries.'
- REPLACE_BATTERIES: |-
    Your lamp is getting dim.  I'm taking the liberty of replacing the
    batteries.
- MISSING_BATTERIES: |-
    Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.  You'd
    best start wrapping this up.
- REMOVE_MESSAGE: |-
    You sift your fingers through the dust, but succeed only in
    obliterating the cryptic message.
- CLUE_QUERY: |-
    Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to
    read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?
- WAYOUT_CLUE: |-
    It says, "There is a way out of this place.  Do you need any more
    information to escape?  Sorry, but this initial hint is all you get."
- DONT_UNDERSTAND: &dont_understand 'I''m afraid I don''t understand.'
- HAND_PASSTHROUGH: 'Your hand passes through it as though it weren''t there.'
- PROD_DWARF: |-
    You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
    you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
- THIS_ACCEPTABLE: 'Is this acceptable?'
# This message is not currently used
#- ALREADY_OVER: |-
#    This adventure is already over.  To start a new adventure, or to
#    resume an earlier adventure, please run a fresh copy of the program.
- OGRE_FULL: 'The ogre doesn''t appear to be hungry.'
- OGRE_DODGE: |-
    The ogre, who despite his bulk is quite agile, easily dodges your
    attack.  He seems almost amused by your puny effort.
- OGRE_PANIC1: |-
    The ogre, distracted by your rush, is struck by the knife.  With a
    blood-curdling yell he turns and bounds after the dwarves, who flee
    in panic.  You are left alone in the room.
- OGRE_PANIC2: |-
    The ogre, distracted by your rush, is struck by the knife.  With a
    blood-curdling yell he turns and bounds after the dwarf, who flees
    in panic.  You are left alone in the room.
- FREE_FLY: 'The bird flies about agitatedly for a moment.'
- CAGE_FLY: 'The bird flies agitatedly about the cage.'
- NECKLACE_FLY: |-
    The bird flies about agitatedly for a moment, then disappears through
    the crack.  It reappears shortly, carrying in its beak a jade
    necklace, which it drops at your feet.
- WATER_URN: |-
    You empty the bottle into the urn, which promptly ejects the water
    with uncanny accuracy, squirting you directly between the eyes.
- OIL_URN: 'Your bottle is now empty and the urn is full of oil.'
- FULL_URN: 'The urn is already full of oil.'
- URN_NOPOUR: 'There''s no way to get the oil out of the urn.'
- URN_NOBUDGE: 'The urn is far too firmly embedded for your puny strength to budge it.'
- URN_GENIES: |-
    As you rub the urn, there is a flash of light and a genie appears.
    His aspect is stern as he advises: "One who wouldst traffic in
    precious stones must first learn to recognize the signals thereof."
    He wrests the urn from the stone, leaving a small cavity.  Turning to
    face you again, he fixes you with a steely eye and intones: "Caution!"
    Genie and urn vanish in a cloud of amber smoke.  The smoke condenses
    to form a rare amber gemstone, resting in the cavity in the rock.
- DOUGHNUT_HOLES: 'I suppose you collect doughnut holes, too?'
- GEM_FITS: 'The gem fits easily into the cavity.'
- RUG_RISES: 'The persian rug stiffens and rises a foot or so off the ground.'
- RUG_WIGGLES: |-
    The persian rug draped over your shoulder seems to wriggle for a
    moment, but then subsides.
- RUG_SETTLES: 'The persian rug settles gently to the ground.'
- RUG_HOVERS: 'The rug hovers stubbornly where it is.'
- RUG_NOTHING1: 'The rug does not appear inclined to cooperate.'
- RUG_NOTHING2: |-
    If you mean to use the persian rug, it does not appear inclined to
    cooperate.
- FLAP_ARMS: 'Though you flap your arms furiously, it is to no avail.'
- RUG_GOES: |-
    You board the persian rug, which promptly whisks you across the chasm.
    You have time for a fleeting glimpse of a two thousand foot drop to a
    mighty river; then you find yourself on the other side.
- RUG_RETURNS: 'The rug ferries you back across the chasm.'
- ALL_SILENT: 'All is silent.'
- STREAM_GURGLES: 'The stream is gurgling placidly.'
- WIND_WHISTLES: 'The wind whistles coldly past your ears.'
- STREAM_SPLASHES: 'The stream splashes loudly into the pool.'
- NO_MEANING: 'You are unable to make anything of the splashing noise.'
- MURMURING_SNORING: |-
    You can hear the murmuring of the beanstalks and the snoring of the
    dwarves.
- SNAKES_HISSING: 'A loud hissing emanates from the snake pit.'
- DULL_RUMBLING: 'The air is filled with a dull rumbling sound.'
- LOUD_ROAR: 'The roar is quite loud here.'
- TOTAL_ROAR: 'The roaring is so loud that it drowns out all other sound.'
- BIRD_CRAP: |-
    The bird eyes you suspiciously and flutters away.  A moment later you
    feel something wet land on your head, but upon looking up you can see
    no sign of the culprit.
- FEW_DROPS: 'There are only a few drops--not enough to carry.'
- NOT_BRIGHT: '(Uh, y''know, that wasn''t very bright.)'
- TOOK_LONG: 'It''s a pity you took so long about it.'
- UPSTREAM_DOWNSTREAM: 'Upstream or downstream?'
- FOREST_QUERY: !!null
- WATERS_CRASHING: 'The waters are crashing loudly against the shore.'
- THROWN_KNIVES: '%d of them throw knives at you!'
- MULTIPLE_HITS: '%d of them get you!'
- ONE_HIT: 'One of them gets you!'
- NONE_HIT: 'None of them hits you!'
- DONT_KNOW: 'Sorry, I don''t know the word "%s".'
- WHAT_DO: 'What do you want to do with the %s?'
- NO_SEE: 'I see no %s here.'

- HELP:
    message: |-
      I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
      describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
      like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,
      up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
      hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
      the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
      object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
      the object from the action alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
      particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to
      give you a list of what you're carrying.  Some objects have unexpected
      effects; the effects are not always desirable!  Usually people having
      trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
      trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
      beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
      different tack.  One point often confusing to beginners is that, when
      there are several ways to go in a certain direction (e.g., if there
      are several holes in a wall), choosing that direction in effect
      chooses one of the ways at random; often, though, by specifying the
      place you want to reach you can guarantee choosing the right path.
      Also, to speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a
      single word.  For example, "building" usually gets you to the building
      from anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note
      that cave passages and forest paths turn a lot, so leaving one place
      heading north doesn't guarantee entering the next from the south.
      However (another important point), except when you've used a "long
      distance" word such as "building", there is always a way to go back
      where you just came from unless I warn you to the contrary, even
      though the direction that takes you back might not be the reverse of
      what got you here.  Good luck, and have fun!

      The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
      occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
      growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
      various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
      all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
      spruce and berry bushes.

- INFO:
    message: |-
      For a summary of the most recent changes to the game, say "news".
      If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit".  To suspend your
      adventure such that you can continue later, say "suspend" (or "pause"
      or "save").  To see how well you're doing, say "score".  To get full
      credit for a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building,
      though you get partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points
      for getting killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.
      There are also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've
      managed to explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for
      getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack),
      and there are other ways to determine whether you've been through some
      of the more harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the
      treasures, just keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting
      happens, you haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting
      *DOES* happen (incidentally, there *ARE* ways to hasten things along),
      it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
      more points in the Master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints
      if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance
      how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to
      save time, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to repeat the
      full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.

      Open Adventure is an author-approved open-source release of
      Version 2.5 with, as yet, no gameplay changes.
      Version 2.5 was essentially the same as Version II; the cave and the
      hazards therein are unchanged, and top score is still 430 points.
      There are a few more hints, especially for some of the more obscure
      puzzles.  There are a few minor bugfixes and cosmetic changes.  You
      can now save a game and resume it at once (formerly you had to wait a
      while first), but it now costs you a few points each time you save the
      game.  Saved games are now stored in much smaller files than before.
